97;A study of street-level navigation techniques in 3D digital cities on mobile touch devices.;2014;Jacek Jankowski|Thomas Hulin|Martin Hachet;6;03/10/2016 21:01;A study of street-level navigation techniques in 3d digital cities on mobile touch devices. J Jankowski, T Hulin, M Hachet - 3D User Interfaces (3DUI),  , 2014 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. ABSTRACT To characterize currently most common interaction techniques for street-level  navigation in 3D digital cities for mobile touch devices in terms of their efficiency and  usability, we conducted a user study, where we compared target selection (Go-To), rate  ..
98;Ramps are better than stairs to reduce cybersickness in applications based on a HMD and a Gamepad.;2014;Jose L. Dorado|Pablo A. Figueroa;5;03/10/2016 20:57;Ramps are better than stairs to reduce cybersickness in applications based on a HMD and a gamepad. JL Dorado, PA Figueroa - 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2014 IEEE , 2014 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. ABSTRACT We study ways to reduce cybersickness and improve the user's experience in  virtual reality applications that use a HMD and a Gamepad as interaction devices. Our  approach consists on a revision of the design space of such tasks in order to identify ways  ..
99;Poster: Wearable input device for smart glasses based on a wristband-type motion-aware touch panel.;2014;Jooyeun Ham|Jonggi Hong|Youngkyoon Jang|Seung Hwan Ko|Woontack Woo;0;28/07/2016 09:36;Poster: Wearable input device for smart glasses based on a wristband-type motion-aware touch panel. J Ham, J Hong, Y Jang, SH Ko - 3D User Interfaces (3DUI) , 2014 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. ABSTRACT This paper presents a smart glasses-augmented, wearable input device based  on a wristband-type, motion-aware touch panel. With this novel input device, a user can  manipulate the smart glasses' augmented reality (AR) system by selecting and moving  ..
100;Interaction-free calibration for optical see-through head-mounted displays based on 3D Eye localization.;2014;Yuta Itoh|Gudrun Klinker;32;03/10/2016 21:17;Interaction-free calibration for optical see-through head-mounted displays based on 3d eye localization. Y Itoh, G Klinker - 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2014 IEEE  , 2014 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. To overcome these problems, we present a method that utilizes dynamic 3D eye position  measurements from an eye tracker in combination with pre-computed, static display  calibration parame ters. Our experiments provide a comparison of our calibration with  ..
